<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I know you want your own website (who doesn’t?)</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">but how? A website is important to your personal brand but hosting a simple, straightforward website can cost around $7 per month. We can do better than that. What’s better than free?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’re going to use github.com to host our website. GitHub hosts public and private repositories for code backups and subversion control but today we’re going to tap into their “GitHub Pages” service to host a simple HTML website</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Disclaimers: This tutorial is moderately-easy to follow. Some familiarity of HTML required. I’m also not affiliated with GitHub</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">I just think it’s awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWest/HostYourSiteOnGithub">Github Repo</a></span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>1. Download GitHub Desktop</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By far, the biggest barrier to utilizing github.com is learning how to use git</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">enter GitHub Desktop and fear no more! This application will interface with github.com and upload all your website files for you. Download the Desktop App <a href="https://desktop.github.com/"><span class="s4">here.</span></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>2. Sign up for a GitHub account</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course you’ll need an account with the platform. Save your username and password, you’ll need these for step 3. Sign up here: <a href="https://github.com//"><span class="s4">here.</span></a> Github </span><span class="s5">→</span><span class="s1"> Preferences</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>3. Sign in to the GitHub Desktop App</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Navigate to Github </span><span class="s5">→</span><span class="s1"> Preferences and sign in to your github.com account. Next, you’ll need to create a new repository. This is where we’ll store the code that will eventually make up your snazzy new website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Create a new repository by navigating to File </span><span class="s5">→</span><span class="s1"> New Repository. Give it a name (remember this for later) and point it to a Local Path on your computer. I keep all my GitHub repositories in a subfolder in my Documents. We’ll edit the file locally (on your computer) and use the GitHub Desktop app to upload these files. Make sure to initialize this repository with a README.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">File </span><span class="s5">→</span><span class="s1"> New RepositoryImportant: after you click Create Repository, don’t forget to click “Publish Repository” in the top right corner:</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>4. Download the appropriate HTML files</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To build a website we’ll use a sparse HTML framework to get you started, coupled with some CSS files to make it look pretty. I usually use Bootstrap, which will give us mobile functionality along with a few templates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why not use the template I’ve already created for you? Download it at my github page here. Click on the green button “Clone or Download” and download the zip file. There is an index.html file (our main website page) and a folder with a few CSS files. You’ll need to unzip the files and move them to the folder on your computer where you set the Local Path to your repository (see step 3). Switch back to the GitHub Desktop app. Add message, Commit, PushIn the message box type something like “First Commit” and click the blue button, “Commit to master.” Don’t forget to click “Push to repository” afterwards in the top right corner.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll need to do those same two actions every time you edit the files on your computer: Commit and Push. Happy pushing!</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>5. Create a GitHub pages branch</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the GitHub Desktop app, navigate to Branch </span><span class="s5">→</span><span class="s1"> New Branch and add a branch called “gh-pages”</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">—</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">this part is important! You must name the new branch gh-pages or this won’t work. After creating the new branch click Publish. Don’t blink, your website is live! Open up a web browser and navigate to “username.github.io/repositoryName” with your github.com username and repository name replaced. You’re welcome.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>6. Buy a domain</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, I know I said that this tutorial would be free. But actually, only the hosting is free. You’ll still need to buy a domain name, unless you want to be stuck with a website at username.github.io/repositoryName for the rest of your life. Don’t @ me. I prefer GoDaddy.com. They have cheap domain names (I bought <a href="http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/"><span class="s4">http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/</span></a> for $1.99 to do this tutorial).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’ll need to change 3 records to point your new domain to our github hosted website. Click the pencil icon to edit each record.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1. Change the first record ( Type: A, Name: @ ) to point to 192.30.252.153. Leave the TTL set at 1 Hour, and click save.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Change the ( Type: CNAME, Name: www) record to point to username.github.io</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3. Add a record ( Type: A, Name: @ ) to point to 192.30.252.154.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>7. Add a CNAME file to your gh-pages account.</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We still need to let your github page know that the DNS settings on GoDaddy exist (more or less…). To do that, we’ll need to add a “CNAME” file back to our github repository. Download mine here, the same way you downloaded my previous GitHub repository in step 4 (this is a link to the gh-pages branch of my repository). Open this file with your favorite text editor and type the name of your website here. (Mine was <a href="http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/"><span class="s4">http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/</span></a>)Go back to the GitHub Desktop app, add a message, Commit and Push. Now go to your GoDaddy domain (i.e. <a href="http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/"><span class="s4">http://hostyoursiteongithub.xyz/</span></a>) and enjoy!</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I would love to hear from you all. You can get in touch with me via my personal website (<a href="http://jeffreybwest.com/"><span class="s4">here.</span></a>, also hosted on GitHub Pages!) with recommendations for new tutorials and questions about this one.
